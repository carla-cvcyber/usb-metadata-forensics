# USB Metadata Forensics  
**Author:** Carla Vieira | 2025  

**Repository Purpose:** A real-world forensic analysis of staged evidence using Autopsy, focused on metadata anomalies and timeline reconstruction.

## 🔍 Overview  
This project supports the blog post *“The Metadata That Caught a Lie: Digital Forensics in Action”*, published on [cvcyber.dev](https://cvcyber.dev).  
It’s based on a digital forensics case where a USB drive was recovered in a suspicious death investigation. At first glance, the files on the device appeared to tell one story—but closer analysis revealed something very different.

By using Autopsy to dig into file metadata and MACtimes, I uncovered inconsistencies that pointed to document tampering and timeline manipulation. What looked like valid evidence didn’t hold up under scrutiny—and that has real consequences in legal, business, and compliance settings.

## 🧪 Featured Case  
**USB Metadata Forensics: Staged Evidence Uncovered**  

Published on cvcyber.dev, this blog post walks through how two files—one text and one spreadsheet—appeared to support a tragic event. But the metadata told a different story.  

Using timeline analysis and author metadata, I demonstrated how falsified files can be used to manipulate investigations. This isn’t just about forensics—it’s about protecting truth in environments where digital evidence shapes outcomes.

This kind of work is especially relevant for:
- Internal fraud investigations  
- HR and legal compliance reviews  
- Incident response and litigation readiness
